# Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Install dependencies with
```
npm install
```

Run server with
```
npm start
```

If you are running the frontend connected to a local backend, go to `frontend/src/app/utils/misc/routes.js` and change `BASEURL` to the localhost url.
